## Tank Game (Unreal Course)

*Concept:
 A one v one tank battle game in which the player plays against either the computer or another player.
Player tries to eliminate other tank (and potentially other threats) while avoiding damage.
Limited number of rounds encourages tactical gameplay choices.

*Rules:
- 1v1 (possible static computer adversaries)
- Last tank standing wins

*Requirements:
- SFX: gun firing, explosions, barrel moving, turret moving, engine sound
- Static Mesh: Simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret and barrel. Possibly mortars.
- Textures: Add later for visual flare
- Music: BG music to increase tension
